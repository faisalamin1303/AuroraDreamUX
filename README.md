## 🌟 **What is Aurora Dream Explorer?**
Aurora Dream Explorer is an open-source, **web-based desktop environment and file explorer** that brings the experience of an Operating System's (OS) explorer to the web. It’s designed with beauty, modularity, and extensibility in mind, creating a dynamic and interactive user interface that developers and users alike can enjoy.

Inspired by the futuristic aesthetics of **Windows 10/11, macOS**, and custom OS environments, this project aims to provide:

- **Beautifully animated backgrounds** 🌈
- **Interactive file explorer windows** 📂
- **Multiple window support** for easy multitasking 🖥️
- **Customizable themes and animations** ✨
- A **dock** for quick access to essential tools 🛠️

It’s not just an emulation—it’s a **dream-like OS experience** in your browser!

## 💡 **Why Aurora Dream Explorer?**
Aurora Dream Explorer is a **playground for developers** who are passionate about UI/UX, web development, and futuristic OS design. This project is **open-source** and actively seeks contributors who can:

- Develop new features like **themes**, **custom animations**, and **effects**.
- Improve **file system logic**, such as file/folder management, file execution, etc.
- Experiment with **3D effects**, **transparency**, and **hover states** to create the OS of the future.
- Make it a more inclusive, accessible, and modular project.

  - **New themes** 🎨
  - **Advanced animations** 🌀
  - **Special effects** such as **transparency** or **hover interactions** 🖱️

### 4. **Interactive Desktop with Icon Tiles**
- The desktop environment allows you to place and interact with various icons such as **My Computer**, **Drives**, and more. Each icon is interactive, with **neon glow effects** and hover states, providing a stunning visual experience.

### 5. **Customizable Dock**
- Aurora Dream Explorer comes with a **translucent dock** that mimics modern OS docks like **macOS**. Easily add shortcuts to different settings or applications, making navigation smooth and intuitive.
